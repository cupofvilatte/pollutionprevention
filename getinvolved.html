            <p>Have you ever wondered if you could have fun picking up trash? Many people have and this is why our brilliant computer scientists from table 7 have constructed new ways by which we will be able to enjoy ourselves while saving the environment!!!! Is this just terrific or what? I think that we can definitely change the world like this! Isnt having fun fun?</p>

            <p>This is an amazing game that we have found that will illustrate the importance of keeping our God-given earth clean and ready for the second coming! I am so incredibly happy to see that these kids, the future of our beautifully crazy society, will have the opportunity to pick up digital trash!!! I think that this is just as important as picking up real trahs! Heck whats the point of picking up real trash when you could pick up the fake stuff???? Wait a minute... </p>

            <p>We here news that stems from insanely mismanaged cities such as San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, and other man made monoliths and we wonder whatever can we do??? This is a huge problem that will affect society, right? Well this is why we wanted to include this game as part of the recyling curriculum that we will be sharing.. As we have provided in the last example, you may pick up fake trash which will help fake society! The goal is to transfer this over to real society btw. Thanks lool</p>
